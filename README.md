## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

Its my first time of using javascript, i learn how to add and remove classes. I use 'mouseenter' and 'mouseleave' in js instead ':hover' in css. I guess that my script.js is ugly for pro devs, but I'm proud of it, because it's my first script.js.

### Continued development

Maybe i can add 'back to rating' button on 'thank you' side of card, and alert message if you try submit without rating.
